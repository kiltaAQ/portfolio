# Indica's Portfolio Project

This is my new portfolio. I made this portfolio to showcase my projects and introduce myself to the clients. I changed everything from the previous version of my portfolio.

## Demo

## Notes

* This portfolio still not responsive yet.
* Using GSAP Animation
* app.js file still very messy since I'm not using timeline for GSAP animating.

*Here's the GSAP CDNs. In case you wanna use it.

``` html
<script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/gsap/3.6.1/gsap.min.js"></script>
<script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/gsap/3.6.1/ScrollTrigger.min.js"></script>
<script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/gsap/3.6.1/EasePack.min.js"></script>
```

## How To Use GSAP

In GSAP we have three basic function:
``` 
gsap.from()    // 1
gsap.to()      // 2
gsap.fromTo()  // 3
```

1. The first function is animating an element from the condition that we given in the GSAP function to the condition in our CSS.
2. The second function is animating an element from the condition in our CSS to the condition in our GSAP function.
3. In the third function we need to define the from and to condition in the GSAP function.
